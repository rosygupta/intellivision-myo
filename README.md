A new kind of input for Google Glass implementing Clarifai API. Images on the go! We came up with a weekend hardware hack to make this a reality at Spartahacks 2016, Michigan State University.

The android application provides a touch-free and voice-free interface to the Google Glass giving REAL-TIME tags of the images that you look at. Now, you can understand every image without using any touch pads, buttons or voice controls. The MYO armband unlocks the power of Clarifai and Google Glass like never before. Firebase is used as the cloud storage and analytics platform to give a customized experience to the user. All the tags from Clariifai are stored in Firebase.

There are two implementations of the Clarifai Api 
  
  * Android Device : camera-tagger
  * Google Glass : glass-camera-tagger
